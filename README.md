# ðŸ”— Meeting Room Booking System

I have developed a comprehensive meeting room booking system, showcasing my expertise in full-stack web development. This platform is designed to simplify the process of booking rooms for meetings and events, providing an intuitive experience for both users and administrators. Key features include:

- Room Booking System: Users can effortlessly browse available meeting rooms, filter by amenities, and book rooms based on date and time preferences. The system provides real-time availability updates, ensuring users can book rooms with confidence.

- Admin Dashboard: The platform features a powerful admin dashboard, allowing administrators to manage room availability, monitor bookings, and update room details such as capacity, amenities, and pricing. Admins can also oversee user activity and generate reports for booking analytics.

- Payment Integration: Secure online payment options are available for paid room bookings, ensuring a smooth transaction process. This feature allows organizations to monetize room rentals and manage payments efficiently.

- User Roles and Permissions: Role-based access control ensures a clear distinction between user typesâ€”whether regular users, administrators. Each role is granted specific permissions, enhancing security and improving functionality for each user group.

- Calendar and Scheduling: The platform includes an interactive calendar view that allows users and admins to see current room bookings and available time slots at a glance. This feature streamlines the scheduling process and prevents double-booking.

- Mobile-Friendly Interface: The platform is designed with a responsive user interface that adapts to all devices, allowing users to book and manage rooms easily from smartphones, tablets, or desktops.

- Security and Data Privacy: The platform implements strict security protocols to protect user data and ensure that all booking and payment information remains confidential. Encryption and secure communication channels are integrated for maximum safety.

This project reflects my technical proficiency in full-stack development, particularly with technologies like React, TypeScript, and ShadCN, and demonstrates my ability to design user-centric solutions for efficient meeting room management. It highlights my focus on creating reliable, scalable, and secure applications that cater to both user and business needs.```
